// Porting Notes.

You'll need CodeWarrior. I'll move to ECGS as soon as OS-X is out.
the major changes to the code have been made, and the MacCompat and MacSource
libraries contain the additional files needed.

// Notes For Both the Compiler and Runner.

// Access paths.

In "Access paths", check "Interpret DOS and UNIX Paths".

In order:

Add the path to ":gd:source:mindy:compat".
Add the path to ":gd:source:mindy:compat".
Add the path to ":gd:source:mindy:comp" or :interp
Add the path to ":gd:source:mindy:interp" or :comp

Add the path to ":gd:source:mindy:Macintosh:MacCompat".
Add the path to ":gd:source:mindy:Macintosh:MacSource:Compiler" or :Interpreter
Add the path to ":gd:source:mindy:Macintosh:MacSource".

Make sure that you add comp and interp in the right order for the relevent target.

// Prefix file.

Set "MacMindyPrefix.h" as your prefix file.

// Compiler Options.

Relaxed pointer type rules, Don't require function prototypes.

// Lex the lexers.

Use the case insensitive option, -i .

// BYACC the parser.

use the command line:
byacc -d -b parser-tab parser.y
Rename the files to parser-tab.c and parser-tab.h
