Gwydion Dylan 1.6 Change Log
</H2>
<H3>The following are enhancements added since Mindy release 1.5:</H3>
<P>
<H3>New stuff:</H3>
<UL>
<LI>The 
  <A HREF="../docs/htdocs/d2c.html">d2c dylan-to-C compiler</A>
     allows efficient compilation of Dylan.
<LI>The 
    <A HREF="../docs/maker-out/melange.htm"> Melange interface generator</A>
     provides a general mechanism for calling C libraries from Dylan.
</UL>
<P>
<H3>Mindy:</H3>
<UL>
   Give much better error in the case where we went to load a library and
   loaded the wrong file, hence didn't find the library definition.  Now if
   you load something in a different library, you get an error, including the
   filename actually loaded.
<P>
   Use ; as a path separator character under NT, rather than the Unix-ish
   colon (:).
<P>
   Now if you have a name clash when trying to import something into a module,
   it'll tell you what module this name clash is taking place in.
<P>
   On Win32, force stdin, stdout, and stderr into binary mode, so that the
   streams library will work correctly on those files.
</UL>
<H3>Common libraries:</H3>
<UL>
   The Streams library has been converted to a spec that both CMU and
   Harlequin agree on.  See
    <A HREF="../docs/maker-out/streams.htm">streams.htm</A> details on the new
    streams.  See 
    <A HREF="../docs/misc/stream-diffs.txt">stream-diffs.txt</A> for how the
    new streams differs from the previous Gwydion streams.
<P>
   The Standard-io module of the Streams library has been moved into
   its own library, called Standard-io.  See
    <A HREF="../docs/maker-out/STANDA~1.htm">standard-io</A>.
<P>
   The Streams library now contains the piped-exec module, which
   exports the piped-exec function.  Similar functionality used to be
   provided by the fd-exec function; see 
   <A HREF="../docs/maker-out/EXTENS~1.htm#E8E44">stream extensions</A>.
<P>
   See also
 <A HREF="../src/common/streams/bbso-stream.dylan">bbso-stream.dylan</A>
    for an efficient string output stream class.
<P>
   The Stream-extensions library has been effectively gutted and
   started over.  Most of the functions that used to be part of
   Stream-extensions are now part of the Streams library; the
   Stream-extensions library now contains the Indenting-streams and
   Concatenated-streams modules.
<P>
   The Regular-expressions module of the String-extensions library has
   been spun off into its own library.  There are also some improvements in
   functionality.  See 
    <A HREF="../docs/maker-out/REGULA~1.htm">regular-expressions</A>.
<P>
   Added the time library.  See time.txt 
    <A HREF="../docs/maker-out/time.htm">time.htm</A>.  Note however that this
    library doesn't compile on all platforms under d2c.
<P>
   The Table-Extensions library has been added.  Most of the
   functionality used to be in the Extensions module of the Dylan
   library; however, see 
    <A HREF="../docs/maker-out/TABLE-~1.htm">table-extensions</A>.
<P>
   The assert() function has been added to the Extensions module of
   the Dylan library.
<P>
   The conditional compilation features compiled-for-x86-win32 and
   compiled-for-hppa-hpux are now defined, if appropriate.  
   See <A HREF="../docs/maker-out/EXTENS~1.htm#E8E38">conditional compilation</A>.
<P>
   The conditional compilation feature newlines-are-CRLF has been
   added.  Consequently, the constant $newlines-are-CRLF, exported
   from the Extensions module of the Dylan library, no longer exists.
<P>
   Added print-object methods for &lt;sequence&gt;, &lt;array&gt;, &lt;table&gt;, and
   &lt;range&gt;.
    see <A HREF="../docs/maker-out/print.htm">print</A>.
<P>
   Added the format-out library.  This provides a shorthand for formatting to
    standard output.
<P>
   Added a whole bunch of new tests to the tests directory.
</UL>
<H3>Inspector:</H3>
<UL>
   Added the "store" command to the text Inspector.  This command
   allows you to store the object currently under inspection into a
   debugger variable; see inspector.txt for details.
<P>
   The Inspector no longer tells you about slot getters and setters or
   type constaints on a slot when you inspect an instance of an
   object.  If you want to see those things, inspect that object's
   class.
</UL>
<HR>
<P>
<BR>
<H3>The following are bug fixes since release 1.5:</H3>
<UL>
   TK now works on Windows/NT.
<P>
   Piped-exec (formerly fd-exec) now works on Windows/NT.
<P>
   WinMindy now uses a special linker (dbclink) to link .dbc files.
   Previously, the Unixish "cat" command was used, which sometimes
   corrupted the .dbc files.  See mindy.txt for details.
<P>
   fd-exec and piped-exec now collect finished child processes.
   Previously, on Unix if you fd-exec'ed enough processes, you could
   overflow the process table, even if those processes had terminated.
<P>
   In interp/module.c, an unreferenced function referenced a
   non-existent function.  This has been fixed.
<P>
   Fixed a bug where if a size: keyword was given to make(&lt;deque&gt;),
   the deque would think it was twice as big as it really was.
<P>
   Fixed ``for (x from 0 below 10) x := x + 1 end'' to work correctly
<P>
   Slot init-args are now processed first to last (ie, the second
   occurence of a init-keyword is ignored when initializing
   instances).
<P>
   Fixed obscure bug in the SAM cache code which caused incorrect
   handling of non-leaf concrete classes.
<P>
   When using the Transcendental module, not all documented methods
   for \^ were present.  This has been fixed.
<P>
   Fixed a bug in the Inspector where strings beginning with # (like
   "#f") would not display correctly.
<P>
   The random-float function in the Random library would sometimes
   produce numbers outside the range asked for.  This has been fixed.
<P>
   Fixed print-object when printing single digit negative integers.
<P>
   &lt;table&gt; and &lt;self-organizing-list&gt; are once again subclasses of
   &lt;stretchy-collection&gt;.  See collext.txt for details on
   &lt;self-organizing-list&gt;.
</UL>
<HR>
<P>
<BR>
<H3>The following are enhancements added since release 1.4:</H3>
<UL>
   Mindy is now compliant with most of the DRM; previous versions of
   Mindy were based on the older DIRM.  See mindy.txt for Mindy's
   deficiencies with respect to the DRM.  The file DIRM-to-DRM.txt
   contains tips on bringing DIRM code up to the new standard.
<P>
   Added the TK library, which is a Dylan binding for TK 4.0 (of
   TCL/TK fame).  See dylan-tk.txt for details.  Also added a
   graphical version of html2txt and a game of Minesweeper.
<P>
   Added the inspect and xinspect commands to the debugger, which
   allow interactive examining of Dylan objects.  See debug.txt and
   inspector.txt for details.
<P>
   Mindy now supports conditional compilation; see mindy.txt for
   details.
<P>
   Added a new defining form, "define function".  See mindy.txt for
   details.
<P>
   For loops now support the "using" option for using iteration
   protocols other than the forward-iteration-protocol.  See mindy.txt
   for details.
<P>
   Added $not-supplied to the Extensions module.  See mindy.txt for
   details.
<P>
   Added the Matrix library, which contains standard matrix
   manipulations like matrix multiply and gaussian elimination.  See
   matrix.txt for details.
<P>
   Mindycomp now gives warning messages when "while" or "until" are
   used inside a for loop (you should use "while:" or "until:"), or  
   when the "foo: (default)" keyword default syntax is used.
   Mindycomp also gives warning messages when the exception name in an
   exception clause is not surrounded by parentheses.
<P>
   Mindycomp now gives warning messages when function return values
   have names but not types.
<P>
   Mindy now gives warnings when next-method() is called without #next
   being declared in the parameter list, because that's required in
   Mindy.  See mindy.txt for details on this deficiency.
<P>
   Mindy now gives warnings when a method's return types do not match
   the generic's return types because return types were not specified
   for the method.  This used to be an error.
<P>
   The function collect-garbage has been added to the System module of
   the Dylan library.  This function can also do a purifying garbage
   collection; see mindy.txt for details.
<P>
   Mindy now supports a different integer model.  In brief, the
   following renaming has been done:
        &lt;integer&gt;              =&gt; &lt;general-integer&gt;
        &lt;fixed-integer&gt;        =&gt; &lt;integer&gt;
        $minimum-fixed-integer =&gt; $minimum-integer
        $maximum-fixed-integer =&gt; $maximum-integer
   See mindy.txt for details.
<P>
   *format-function* and *force-output-function* have been replaced by
   condition-format.  See mindy.txt for details.
<P>
   The functions load-file and load-library have been added to the
   Extensions module.  See mindy.txt for details.
<P>
   The function abstract?, which tells you if a class is an abstract
   class, has been added to the Introspections module of the Dylan
   library.
<P>
   The function instantiable?, which tells you if a class is either
   concrete or has an applicable method on make which is not the
   default make method, has been added to the Introspections module of
   the Dylan library.
<P>
   Added &lt;byte&gt; to the Extensions module.  See mindy.txt for details.
<P>
   Added &lt;buffer-index&gt; and $maximum-buffer-size to System module.
   See mindy.txt for details.
<P>
   Object printing in the Print library is now generally more terse,
   but still within the spec laid out in print.txt.
<P>
   Limited-integer-class is now limited-integer-base-class,
   limited-integer-min is now limited-integer-minimum, and
   limited-integer-max is now limited-integer-maximum.  See mindy.txt
   for details.
<P>
   Mindy will now return an exit status of 1 if the debugger "quit"
   command was used to exit the interpretter.
<P>
   The function type-or in the Extensions module of the Dylan library
   has been removed.  Use type-union instead.
<P>
   Since the Dylan language no longer has ratios, all ratio stuff
   (&lt;ratio&gt;, ratio, numerator, denominator) has been moved to the
   Extensions library.  See mindy.txt for details.
<P>
   The class &lt;dictionary&gt; in the Extensions module of the Dylan
   library has been removed.  Use &lt;mutable-explicit-key-collection&gt;
   instead.
<P>
   In the Regular-expressions module of the String-Extensions library,
   the join() function now only works on byte strings.
</UL>

<P>
<BR>
<H3>The following are bug fixes since release 1.4:</H3>
<UL>
   Abstract classes may no longer be intantiated with the default make
   method.
<P>
   &lt;object-table&gt;s now work when given &lt;extended-integer&gt;s or &lt;ratio&gt;s
   for keys.
<P>
   Find-method() now accepts any type of &lt;sequence&gt; as an argument,
   not just &lt;list&gt;.
<P>
   Sort() now handles pathological cases better.
<P>
   Fixed a bug in ash where it would try to allocate extended integers
   of a negative length.
<P>
   Mindy now drops to the debugger when asked to allocate an
   excessively large object, rather than dumping core.
<P>
   "Subclass" slots are now "each-subclass" slots.
<P>
   In the Regular-expressions module of the String-Extensions library,
   the split() function will now remove empty items correctly in all
   cases.
<P>
   Regular expressions functions will now signal an &lt;illegal-regexp&gt;
   error when given a regular expression that is parsable but would be
   uninterpretable.  See String-extensions.txt for details.
<P>
   Fixed a bug in the Regular-expressions module of the
   String-Extensions library where escaped characters would be unescaped
   once too many times.
<P>
   Fill! now returns a value of the correct type.
<P>
   Under Win32, the first line of console input would sometimes be
   dropped.  This has been fixed.
<P>
   The Mindy documentation now documents &lt;string-table&gt;.
</UL>
<HR>
<P>
<BR>
<H3>The following are enhancements added since release 1.3:</H3>
<UL>
   Ported Mindy to Windows/NT, Solaris, and AIX.  See README for
   details on obtaining the different versions of Mindy.
<P>
   Replaced the old Random library with a brand new library of the
   same name.  See random.txt for details.
<P>
   Added the Transcendental module to the Dylan library.  See
   mindy.txt for details.
<P>
   Added the Sequence-diff module to the Collection-Extensions
   library.  Added a Unix style "diff" program the demo directory.
   See collection-extensions.txt and demos.html for details.
<P>
   Added the "next" debugger command which is like "step" but skips over
   function calls.
<P>
   Extended the "continue" debugger command to be able to continue
   from more contexts.
<P>
   Added an option to specify how often to run the garbage
   collector.  If the environment variable BYTES_CONSED_BETWEEN_GCS
   is set, that value will be used; otherwise a default value of 2
   megs will be used.  See mindy.txt for details.
<P>
   Added the ~== operator described in the DRM.  See mindy.txt for
   details.
<P>
   Made ~ a true function, rather than mere syntax.
</UL>
<H3>The following are bug fixes since release 1.3:</H3>
<UL>
   When initializing a class, an error is now signalled if the
   argument to an init-function is not actually a function.
<P>
   Fixed a bug in the Streams library where read-as would sometimes
   return #f even though to-eof? was supplied as #t.
<P>
   In the Streams library, &lt;random-access-stream&gt; is now exported.  See
   streams.txt for details.
<P>
   In the fd module of the Dylan library, if an exec fails while doing
   an fd-exec(), the child process will now exit gracefully.  An error
   is not signalled.
</UL>
<H3>The following are enhancements added since release 1.2:</H3>
<UL>
   Mindy now supports ratios.  For details, please see mindy.txt.
<P>
   Garbage collection reporting is now optional, with the default
   value being no reporting.  See mindy.txt for details.
<P>
   Added while: and until: syntax to for statement.  The old syntax is
   still supported.  Words like class, keyed-by, and module are now
   unresevered words.
<P>
   Added &lt;string-table&gt; to the Extensions module.  See mindy.txt for
   details.
<P>
   A new test, threaded-io-test, has been added to the tests
   directory.  This program tries to read from three different streams
   simultaneously.  However, the program is interactive, and for that
   reason is not run by the makefile.
<P>
   The constants in the File-Descriptors module of the Dylan library
   have been made POSIX conformant.  The seek constants L_SET, L_INCR,
   L_XTND have been replaced with the POSIX equivalents SEEK_SET,
   SEEK_CUR, SEEK_END.  ONDELAY has been changed to ONONBLOCK.  The
   non-POSIX constants FCREAT, FTRUNC, and FEXCL have been removed,
   since they already had POSIX equivalents.  ONDELAY, FNDELAY ELOOP,
   EDQUOT, EOPNOTSUPP, and ETXTBSY have been removed, since they are
   unused and cause portability problems.  See mindy.txt for more
   details.
<P>
   In the Streams library, modified read-line and write-line to make
   use of the constant $newlines-are-CRLF, which is exported from the
   System module of the Dylan library.  Whenever $newlines-are-CRLF is
   not #f, read-line drops any \r characters that appear before a
   linefeed character.  Neither the \r nor the linefeed appear in the
   resulting string that represents the line.  Whenever
   $newlines-are-CRLF, write-line writes a \r before writing the
   linefeed.
</UL>
<HR>
<P>
<BR>
<H3>The following are bug fixes since release 1.2:</H3>
<UL>
   Printing, formatting, and converting $minimum-fixed-integer now
   work correctly.
<P>
   make(&lt;table&gt;, size: 0) now works.
<P>
   NaN's now compare correctly.
<P>
   remove-key! now works on &lt;self-organizing-list&gt;s.
<P>
   Corrected the precedence of ^.  Brought the associativity of ^ into
   line with other languages; used to be left associative (as
   specified in the DIRM), now is right associative.
<P>
   Apply now makes sure the object being applied is really a function.
<P>
   as(&lt;float&gt;, extended-integer) now works correctly when the extended
   integer is negative.
<P>
   logbit? on extended integers now returns #f when given a negative
   index.
<P>
   ceiling and round now work for extended integers.
<P>
   every? for vectors now works.
<P>
   Random-uniform from the Random library now works in the presence of
   extended integers.
<P>
   Weak pointers now will not crash the garbage collector, even in
   obscure cases.
<P>
   applicable-method?, when called with the same arguments twice in a
   row, would always return #t.  That has been fixed.
<P>
   shrink! now works correctly.
<P>
   Fixed a bug in buffer-subsequences from the Streams library.  This
   function had worked only when the result type requested was a
   &lt;byte-string&gt;.  If you requested a result type of &lt;buffer&gt; or
   &lt;byte-string&gt;, you got a run-time type error.
<P>
   Fixed a bug in the Streams library that was triggered when reading
   to the end of a &lt;random-access-stream&gt; in one high-level call with
   the to-eof: keyword argument.
</UL>
<HR>
<P>
<BR>
<H3>The following are enhancements added since release 1.1:</H3>
<UL>
   Mindy now runs on even more Unix platforms.  See ``INSTALL'' for a
   listing of known successful builds.  Thanks are due to Roger
   Critchlow for doing the bulk of the portability enhancements.
<P>
   Mindy installation now only requires an ANSI C compiler, any ``make''
   utiltiy, and ``/bin/sh''.  Previous versions of Mindy required GNU CC
   (gcc), GNU flex, GNU bison, and GNU make (gmake).
<P>
   Mindy now uses a ``configure'' script to handle configuration.
   See ``INSTALL'' for more details.
<P>
   Mindy now comes with several files that have been compiled for you
   (they compile into portable C).  There is no need to re-compile these
   files, but if you should desire to do so you will need GNU flex, GNU
   bison, and Perl.
<P>
   Mindy now contains a new subdirectory ``compat'', which in
   combination with the configure script is used to smooth out the
   differences between the different kinds of Unix machines.
<P>
   There is now a Mindy test suite in the ``tests'' subdirectory.  The
   tests cover the Dylan module of the Dylan library and the
   Regular-Expressions module of the String-Extensions library.
<P>
   ``mc'' has been renamed ``mindycomp''.
<P>
   main() now has a required parameter argv0 which contains the name
   of the file that was executed (similar to C's argv[0]).  See
   mindy.txt for details.
<P>
   Added the Print library, which contains extendable code for
   printing arbitrary objects.  If an object has a Dylan literal
   syntax, then it is printed with that syntax.  All other objects are
   printed in an implementation-dependent manner.  See
   $INSTALL/doc/print.{ps,txt} for more information.
<P>
   Added the Format library, which contains extendable code for
   concisely expressing formatted output.  The format control strings
   supported by this library are upwardly compatibile with the error
   function's format strings.  See $INSTALL/doc/format.{ps,txt} for
   more information.
<P>
   Moved all the Extensions module I/O routines to the Cheap-IO module
   of the Dylan library.  Added fflush to the Cheap-IO module.  See
   $INSTALL/doc/mindy.{ps,txt} for more information.
<P>
   The Streams library now exports stream locking functions.  The
   generic functions used to extend the streams protocol to new
   streams have changed slightly.  The Streams interface now returns
   no values for functions that are called purely for side-effects;
   these functions used to return a meaningless #f value.  See
   $INSTALL/doc/streams.{ps,txt} for more information.
<P>
   Added the String-Extensions library, which contains code to deal
   with regular expressions, substring searches, and other string and
   character related issues.  Moved the string searching functions
   from Collection-Extensions to the Substring-Search module of
   String-Extensions.  Renamed the String-Search module of the
   Collection-Extensions library to Vector-Search.  See
   collection-extensions.txt and string-extensions.txt for details. 
<P>
   &lt;so-list&gt; and the Solist module of Collection-extensions have been
   renamed &lt;self-organizing-list&gt; and Self-organizing-list,
   respectively.
<P>
   There is a new abstract collection class called &lt;dictionary&gt;.
   &lt;table&gt; from the Dylan module and &lt;self-organizing-list&gt; from the
   Self-Organizing-List module of Collection-extensions are now
   subclasses of &lt;dictionary&gt;.  Remove-key! is now a generic function 
   on &lt;dictionary&gt;s.  &lt;Dictionary&gt; is exported from the Extensions
   module; see mindy.txt for details.
<P>
   Mindy now gives warnings about undefined variables.
<P>
   Mindy now has infinite precision integer arithmetic.  Added &lt;fixed-integer&gt;,
   &lt;extended-integer&gt;, $minimum-fixed-integer, and $maximum-fixed-integer
   to the Extensions module.
<P>
   Mindy now has Unicode support.  &lt;byte-character&gt; is now exported
   from the Extensions module, and is a subclass of &lt;character&gt;
   (&lt;character&gt; is really a unicode character).
<P>
   When searching for a library, Foo, Mindy first looks for foo-lib.dbc
   in $MINDYPATH, and failing to find that file, searches for foo.dbc.
<P>
   Added key-exits?(collection, key) to the Extensions module.  See
   mindy.txt for details.
<P>
   Created the Introspective module in the Dylan library.  See
   mindy.txt for deatils.
<P>
   An error is now signalled if the parent of a subclass has not yet
   been initialized when the subclass is defined.
</UL>
<H3>The following are bug fixes since release 1.1:</H3>
<UL>
   Can no longer add methods to things that aren't generic functions.
<P>
   Logbit now takes its arguments in the correct order.
<P>
   Logand, logxor, and logior are now binary operators.
<P>
   size: on a &lt;table&gt; now does the right thing.
<P>
   Fixed a pair of bugs in the garbage collection.
</UL>
<HR>
<P>
<BR>
<H3>The following are enhancements added since release 1.0:</H3>
<UL>
   Mindy now compiles under SunOS, Ultrix, and Linux.
<P>
   Inherited and keyword class slot options are now supported.
<P>
   Added support for \a, \e, and \0 in string and character literals.
<P>
   Added some additional error checking.
<P>
   Added a "describe" debugger command.  See debug.txt for details.
<P>
   The debugger "module" command now annotates the listing of modules with
   "i"s and "x"s to indicate modules that are imported, exported, or both.
</UL>
<H3>The following are bug fixes since release 1.0:</H3>
<UL>
   Return type declarations such as "#rest foo :: &lt;integer&gt;" are interpreted
   correctly now.
<P>
   "Large functions" no longer trigger an internal error in the compiler.
<P>
   Literal list syntax inside 'if' bodies no longer cause the compiler to
   die.
<P>
   Fixed an off-by-one error that made it impossible to debug source files
   longer than 1000 lines.
<P>
   Fixed 'define class' to generate correct implicit generic function
   signatures for the slot getters and setters.  Mindy used to define the
   generic function as returning one value, but now Mindy defines it to
   return "#rest results :: &lt;object&gt;".  This new behavior corresponds to a
   proposal for how implicit generic function signatures should be generated
   in Dylan.  The basic idea is that implicit generic function signatures
   should be as general as possible to allow methods added later by users
   the greatest chance of matching the generic function's signature.
<P>
   Slot-initialized? works now.
<P>
   Fixed a typo bug that caused a setter to be called instead of a getter
   for some slots of classes that had multiple direct superclasses.
<P>
   Mindy no longer gets a segmentation violation when it is invoked with a
   -f switch that is not followed by a filename.
<P>
   Error's format control strings were previously case-sensitive with
   respect to format directives.  Now the directives are case-insensitive.
<P>
   The Dylan module of the Dylan library now exports the identifiers
   row-major-index, rank, and dimension.
<P>
   The arguments for adjust-stream-position on &lt;fd-file-stream&gt;s were
   backwards, and now they agree with the stream specification.
<P>
   The arguments for write and write-line were backwards in the
   documentation, and now the documentation agrees with the code.
