This is a development version of Pidgin, a tool for parsing C headers and
generating Dylan bindings. Many of the parts are designed to be reusable.

This version is intended for review and public comment.

Current status:

 * ANSI C library
   - C type model should be essentially complete
   - C declaration model should be essentially complete

 * C parser
   - Almost entirely integrated
   - Many new bug fixes
   - Basic search paths work
   - Need to improve API

See the TODO file for more information.

Please mail your feedback to <eric.kidd@pobox.com>. You can find more
information about pidgin in the comp.lang.dylan newsgroup and on the
Gwydion Dylan website at:
