THINGS TO DO
------------

Here's a rough list of things to do before the C parser is integrated.

 * Cut out dead code.
 * Figure out why GL/gl.h parses so much slower than ansi-test.h.
   - source-location seems to be part of the problem. A bit part, too.
 * Profile.
   - Wasting time in source-location.
   - Wasting time in generic function dispatch.
   - Wasting time calling forward-iteration-protocol.
   - Somebody's burning a *lot* of time comparing things.
 * How fast is appending a chunk to the end of a <stretchy-vector>?
   - Not too bad... It only resizes every 1024 elements or so.
 * How bad does fast-string-hash suck when run on the OpenGL headers?
   - Oh, wow. That's nasty.
 * Figure out what to do with sizeof.
 * Polish c-parser API.
