Other parts of Pidgin originated in Melange, a similar tool written by the
Gwydion Group at CMU. That code bears the following license:

I have been informed of CMU's intent to rerelease Melange into the public
domain along with the rest of Gwydion Dylan and Gwydion Sheets.

These licenses permit the use of Pidgin in proprietary and GPL'd
applications. However, if you enhance Pidgin, I request (but do not
require) that you contribute some or all of your changes to the public
under the first copyright in this file.
