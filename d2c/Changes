d2c 1.0 Change Log

The following are enhancements added since the September 2 affiliates release:

   d2c now works on Windows/NT with the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler.
   dig, the debugger, does not.  See ### something.txt for details.

   The Stream-extensions library has been effectively gutted and
   started over.  Most of the functions that used to be part of
   Stream-extensions are now part of the Streams library; the
   Stream-extensions library now contains the Indenting-streams and
   Concatenated-streams modules.  See stream-ext.txt for details.

   The Streams library now contains the piped-exec module, which
   exports the piped-exec function.  Similar functionality used to be
   provided by the fd-exec function; see mindy.txt for details.  ###
   also bbso-stream

   Many things that used to be warnings are now errors.

   Compilation of programs with errors are now aborted more quickly.

   Added the -delayed-binaries flag.

   Added an implicitly-define-next-method switch. 


The following are bug fixes since the September 2 affiliates release:

   Slots with unknown types no longer cause the compiler to crash.

   fd-exec and piped-exec now collect finished child processes.
   Previously, on Unix if you fd-exec'ed enough processes, you could
   overflow the process table, even if those processes had terminated.

   Fixed write-integer of $minimum-integer to work. 

   The d2c usage message has been brought up to date.
