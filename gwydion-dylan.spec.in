%description
CMU's Gwydion Dylan provides d2c, a Dylan-to-C batch compiler. It produces
fairly efficient output but requires strange incantations to compile even
simple programs. Tools for interfacing with C are included. (The Mindy
bytecode interpreter is available as a separate package.) If you're really
excited about writing Dylan programs for Linux--and don't mind the
inconveniences of d2c--these are the tools to use. If you prefer a mature
development environment, try another language.

For more infomration, see the Gwydion Dylan maintainers' web page at

%package extras
Summary: Tools used for recompiling Gwydion Dylan
Requires: gwydion-dylan
Group: Development/Languages/Dylan
Prefix: /usr

%description extras
These tools are required to recompile d2c. They include a LISP to Dylan
translator, a parser generator, and various tools for maintaining the
build tree. This package also contains a few general-purpose development
utilities written in Dylan.


%package -n mindy
Summary: CMU's Gwydion Dylan interpreter
Group: Development/Languages/Dylan
Prefix: /usr

%description -n mindy
Mindy is a Dylan bytecode interpreter, originally written as part of CMU's
Gwydion Dylan project. It compiles faster than d2c and includes much better
debugging tools. Unfortunately, Mindy makes no attempt to run fast.

Documentation for Mindy can be found in the main gwydion-dylan package, or
on the web at <http://www.gwydiondylan.org/>.
